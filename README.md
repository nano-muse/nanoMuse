🧸 **nanoMuse** is an open-source, self-hosted personal agent in the shape of Meta's [Muse](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/09/introducing-muse-personal-ai-agent/), made to work in China: one agent with a name and a face, on your phone, that does things rather than answering questions, keeps working while the app is closed, and asks before anything you could not undo. Where Muse leans on Western services with APIs, nanoMuse will also work the apps on your phone through their screens (12306, WeChat, Alipay…) as a GUI agent, so the same agent works where those APIs do not exist. Any OpenAI-compatible model. One Python package, a web app inside it, and an Android app.

## What can nanoMuse do?

nanoMuse is a personal agent you talk to from your phone. It can:

- research, write pages and documents, run shell commands and Python, send mail, read your calendar and your contacts, browse the web
- operate the apps on your phone through their screens when there is no API — look up trains in 12306, read and answer WeChat, work through Alipay — with a switch, and a stop at every send or pay button ([docs/gui.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/docs/gui.md))
- stop and ask before anything hard to undo, with an approval you scope (once, this task, always) and can revoke
- work on goals over weeks while the app is closed, check in on a schedule, and start work when mail arrives, an event is near or a webhook fires
- write you a feed: short posts from what it knows about you and what you asked it to follow
- remember you in a memory you can read, edit and forget, and recall it by meaning
- follow skills in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format and use any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server
- run on any OpenAI-compatible model: DeepSeek, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, a gateway with its own headers

## 💡 Why nanoMuse

- **The Muse shape, in the open**: chat, feed, ideas, goals and library on a phone; a plush avatar that moves while it works; one agent, not a bot framework.
- **Safety is the architecture**: the agent never touches a tool directly. A `Sentinel` decides allow / ask / deny per call, keeps secrets out of the model, tracks where private data goes, and logs everything. On Linux every command runs in its own [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) sandbox.
- **Your machine, your model**: runs on a laptop, a home server or in Docker. Chat Completions or the Responses API, streaming, native or prompt-based tool calling, local models included.
- **Small enough to read**: about 18k lines of typed Python, 11k of TypeScript and 800 of Kotlin. No orchestration framework underneath. About 240 tests.

## 📦 Install

Python 3.11 or newer, on Linux, macOS or Windows. The phone app ships inside the package; Node is only needed to change `web/`. The Android app is a separate download, see [Android](#-android).

| Track | Install with | Update with |
|---|---|---|
| Stable | `uv tool install nanomuse` or `pip install nanomuse` | the same tool, `--upgrade` |
| Latest | `uv tool install git+https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse.git` | run it again |
| Source | `git clone` + `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` | `git pull` |

```bash
uv tool install nanomuse
nanomuse version
```

Optional: `nanomuse[browser]` adds the Playwright browser tool (then `playwright install chromium`).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
nanomuse config init                 # writes config/config.toml
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...       # the default config uses DeepSeek; see Models below
nanomuse serve --host 0.0.0.0        # prints a URL and a QR code
```

Scan the QR code with your phone on the same Wi-Fi, or open the URL here. The link carries the access token. Setup runs the first time: your name, the agent's name and face, the model. Then try:

1. *"Compare the Sony WH-1000XM6 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra for long flights and save a short comparison to headphones.md"*
2. *"Check how much free disk space this machine has"*, which stops on an approval card
3. *"Set up a goal: conversational Japanese before my Kyoto trip in December, 30 minutes a day"*, then open Goals

Prefer the terminal? `nanomuse chat` is the same agent with approvals in the console; `nanomuse run "task"` does one task and exits. Something off? `nanomuse doctor` checks the config, the model and the connectors and says what to fix.

## 📱 Android

[**Download nanomuse.apk**](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/releases/latest/download/nanomuse.apk) from the latest release and open it on the phone. Android 8.0 or newer, any CPU. It is not from a store, so Android asks once to allow the install.

Then `nanomuse serve --host 0.0.0.0` on your computer, tap **Scan QR code** in the app and point the camera at the terminal. Same Wi-Fi, a VPN such as Tailscale, or your server behind TLS all work.

What the app adds over the browser tab:

- notifications while the app is closed: approvals, questions and the last word of background work, each opening the right chat
- connect by QR code, plain `http://` on the LAN
- the file picker for attachments, downloads to the phone, links in the real browser

No Android? Add the web app to the home screen instead; it installs as a PWA and gets Web Push over `https://`. Build the APK yourself or read how it works in [docs/android.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/docs/android.md).

## ☁️ Deploy

```bash
docker run -d --name nanomuse -p 8787:8787 -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -v nanomuse-data:/data -v "$PWD/workspace:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse:latest
docker logs nanomuse            # the URL with the access token
```

The image is linux/amd64 and linux/arm64; `:latest-browser` bundles Chromium for the browser tool. From a checkout, `docker compose up -d app` does the same and `docker compose up -d daemon` advances goals with no UI. To reach it from outside your network, put it behind Tailscale or a reverse proxy with TLS rather than opening the port. Details, including a systemd unit: [docs/deployment.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/docs/deployment.md).

## 🌐 The app

`nanomuse serve` runs the agent and serves the app from one process: FastAPI with a WebSocket for live events, React on the phone, built into the package.

| Screen | What you get |
|---|---|
| Chat | One main conversation and side chats. Replies stream in; tool calls show as chips you can open; files it writes open in the app. Approval and question cards appear inline. Attach photos and files; watch it browse and take over for a sign-in. |
| Feed | *Feed instructions* in your words, and posts the agent writes from them once a day or on demand. Below, what happened while you were away and every card still waiting for you. |
| Ideas | Things to ask next, from your goals, memory and recent conversation, grouped by area. Tap one to send it. |
| Goals | *Tracking*: checked on a schedule. *Goals*: done step by step. Each with a plan, a target date, notes, and a proposal when the plan no longer fits. A proactivity dial and quiet hours set how much it does on its own. |
| Library | Everything it made, newest first, with previews. Pages render in a sandbox that cannot reach your token. |
| Avatar | Tap it: the status and a *Stop* button, approvals across all chats, the activity log, permissions you granted, what is upcoming, memory, skills, connections, settings. |

Reminders ("remind me at six to call mum"), routines ("every weekday at 07:30, a one-line weather check") and triggers (new mail, a calendar event, a webhook) are set from the chat and listed under *Upcoming*. Everything the app does goes through a REST + WebSocket API, documented in [docs/app.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/docs/app.md), so another front-end can drive the same agent.

## 🛡️ Sentinel

Every tool call goes through `Sentinel` before it runs. Tools declare a risk level and can raise it for a specific call (`shell` on `rm -rf`, `web_fetch` on a private address). First match wins:

1. `deny_tools` → deny
2. `[[sentinel.rules]]` matching the arguments → the rule's action
3. `always_allow_tools` / `always_ask_tools`
4. Taint: private data was read this session **and** this call sends data outside `egress_allowlist` → ask
5. Risk × mode: `ask` asks for sensitive calls, `strict` also for moderate ones, `auto` allows what is not denied
6. A call with a warning (`sudo`, `curl | sh`, code that deletes files) asks whatever the mode

```toml
[sentinel]
mode = "ask"                              # ask | strict | auto
always_ask_tools = ["send_email", "shell"]
egress_allowlist = ["*.wikipedia.org", "github.com", "*.github.com"]

[[sentinel.rules]]
tool   = "shell"
match  = { command = "*rm -rf*" }
action = "deny"
```

Secrets live in an encrypted vault (`nanomuse vault set EMAIL_PASSWORD`, or the Connections screen) and are referenced as `{{vault:EMAIL_PASSWORD}}`; Sentinel fills them in right before a call and redacts them from the output, so the model never sees one. Every decision goes to `audit.jsonl`. What is and is not covered: [docs/sentinel.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/docs/sentinel.md); reporting: [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## 🧠 Models

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Edit `[llm]` in `config/config.toml`, or pick a preset under *Connections* on the phone:

```toml
[llm]
provider = "openai"                    # Chat Completions; "openai_responses" for the Responses API
model    = "deepseek-flash"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
api_key  = "${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}"

# OpenAI:      model = "gpt-5.6-sol"  base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"   api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
# Ollama:      model = "qwen3:8b"     base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"   api_key = "ollama"
# OpenRouter:  model = "deepseek/deepseek-flash"  base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
# A gateway that needs headers:  extra_headers = { "X-End-User-Id" = "nanomuse" }
# An endpoint that ignores `tools`:  tool_mode = "prompt"
```

Or `NANOMUSE_LLM_MODEL`, `NANOMUSE_LLM_BASE_URL`, `NANOMUSE_LLM_API_KEY`, `NANOMUSE_LLM_PROVIDER`. Local models work: `qwen3:8b` on Ollama passes the [provider check](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/scripts/provider_check.py) with native tool calling, `gemma3:4b` through the prompt fallback.

## nanoMuse and Meta Muse

| Meta Muse | nanoMuse |
|---|---|
| Runs in a per-user secure VM | Runs on your machine or in Docker; on Linux each `shell` / Python call gets its own bubblewrap namespace |
| Sentinel approves sensitive actions | `Sentinel`: allow / ask / deny, rules, taint tracking, egress allowlist, scoped approvals |
| Credentials never reach the model | Encrypted vault, `{{vault:NAME}}` placeholders, output redaction |
| Remembers you | SQLite memory the agent keeps tidy and you can edit, recalled by keyword and by meaning |
| Works on goals in the background | Goals with steps; a scheduler advances them and reports to the chat |
| A feed written for you | Posts from your instructions and what it knows, once a day or on demand |
| iOS and Android apps | A web app installable to the home screen, and an Android app |
| Meta's models | Any OpenAI-compatible model |
| Closed | MIT |

## Releases

**v0.1.0 is the first release** and is being prepared: the agent and its Sentinel, the web app, the Android app, the phone operator on the simulated phone, the hosted showcase. Until it is tagged, `main` is the version to run — `pip install git+https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse.git` or the `ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse:edge` image.

[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) · [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/releases)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Android executor: the nanoMuse app operates real apps through an accessibility service (screenshots, gestures, the finger overlay), with Shizuku as an option
- [ ] Local build: the brain inside the APK, so the phone needs no server
- [ ] Free starter quota through the showcase gateway, then your own key
- [ ] Muse features still missing: durable tasks with a take-over hand-off, watches that trigger on the world, ideas with evidence, a follow-up queue
- [ ] Voice: speak a message and see it as text before it goes, through any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions`
- [ ] iOS: the same shell as the Android app
